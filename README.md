# [Fatal Engine](https://www.github.com/Goofgoof43/Fatal-Engine)
Is an open-source, quality of life and performance driven [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine!
Inspired by the works of YoshiCrafter Engine, Psych Engine, and practically every other FNF' Engine
----------------------------------------------



This was built off of

----------------------------------------------
This is built off of the legacy version of Forever Engine. This version lacks accessibility and cohesion, something we are currently working to fix with the more newer and updated rewrite. Thank you for your patience.

**FATAL ENGINE IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRASHES/PROBLEMS WITH HTML5, NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING HTML5**
----------------------------------------------
Currently contains the following features from Forever Engine:
Noteskins,
Custom UIs,
Options Menu with FPS Capping and adjustments
Colorblind options (regardless of if you are colorblind or not, these still look radical, bro.)
And more stuff that I don't know of.

Made with respect to the modding community in order to give them something they might enjoy. Are you up 4 the challange!

How to Compile:
----------------------------------------------
Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup/setup.bat file (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with FNF', this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
Some libraries are from Psych Engine, which is needed to run some Psych Engine stuff within the engine. I hope this does work, but even then, unless you are a developer, there shouldn't really be a reason to compile.
